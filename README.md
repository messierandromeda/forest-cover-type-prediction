Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways - Horz Dist to nearest roadway \
Hillshade_9am (0 to 255 index) - Hillshade index at 9am, summer solstice \
Hillshade_Noon (0 to 255 index) - Hillshade index at noon, summer solstice \
Hillshade_3pm (0 to 255 index) - Hillshade index at 3pm, summer solstice \
Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points - Horz Dist to nearest wildfire ignition points \
Wilderness_Area (4 binary columns, 0 = absence or 1 = presence) - Wilderness area designation \
